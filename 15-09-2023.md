## Terraform Cont...

### Scenario
- To create any resource we will be creating few terraform files
    - main.tf
    - variables.tf
    - output.tf
    - provider.tf
- These are the common files which has to be created for creating a single resource
- My requirement is to create 100 resources for diff environemt
- To do that we have to replicate all the 4 files and modify it accordingly
- In practially it is not simple as expected
- What is the solution for that?

### Terraform Modules
- We have a concept in Terraform called **Modules** where we can use these modules to create a **re-usable** code.
- Write once use many times
- Advantage with the Modules is that, we can just pass a few inputs with out writing the code completely, by just calling the modlue and passing inputs will create a resouce for us.
- To specify the modules information we have to pass a vaible with path call it as **source**
- There are two way to initiate modules
    1. In your local respository
    2. Remote place

### Structure of Modlues
- The way how we are creating our resources this is similar to that, the difference when ever you are creating your resource you have to call that resource with modules block

1. Resouce File
```
resource "aws_instance" "my-ec2" {
  ami = var.pick-ami[var.region]
  # ami   = ${lookup(var.pick-ami, var.region)}
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = "jenkins-server"
  vpc_security_group_ids = var.security-group

  tags = {
    Name = "My-EC2-Instance"
  }
}
```
2. Where ever you are creating your resource you have to specify the path of resouce file
```
module "<module-name>" {
  source = "<path>"

  <input1> = "<value1>"
  <input2> = "<value2>"
  <input3> = "<value3>"
  
}
```
- After defining modules and resources you have do **terraform init**
- It will try to download the modules while initializing

### Types of Modules
- There are two way to initiate modules
    1. In your local respository - Try to create a resources in your same repo and call that as modules in your terraform file. Path will be as **relative path**
    2. Remote place - We will be creating modules in a seperate repository and we will call that moules in your terraform file with **URL**

- *Example*
```
1. source = ../../module-name

2. source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git"
```
- When you do terraform init the output will be as follows
```
C:\> terraform init
Initializing modules...
- ec2-module in modules

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v5.14.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

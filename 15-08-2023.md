    - **pipeline** - This is the frist step we will be wirting to create your script.
    - **stages** - This is the place where we will be deciding to create multiple stages in your **Build**
    - **stage** - This Parameter is used to show the stage name and no of stages can be writing by duplicating this stage parameter.

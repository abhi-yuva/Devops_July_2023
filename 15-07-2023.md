# Few Terminologies:

## Repository
- Repository is nothing but a Data Storage kind where we can store information along with history is maintained
- We will have meta data along with the information(Raw Data).
- Meta data will contain the information like
    - Timestamp
    - Owner Information
    - Commit ID
    - Commit Message
    - Changes
    - Versions
- When it comes to repository, we have 2kinds of repositories
    - Source code repository
        - It will be used for maintaing the code
    - Package repository
        - It will be used for maintaing the packages
        - Examples
            1. Chacolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows
            2. Yum/Apt-get Package for Linux
            3. Brew for MAC OS
## Version Control System(VCS)
- Version control System will maintain the different versions in our code. It will be used to store all the versions of your code
- With this we can go back to older versions and can able to see the differences and we can move from one version to another version
- Features of VCS
    - Repository (Meta-data)
    - Multi User Support
    - Sychonization Option
    - Tags for different versions
        - Example
            - V1.0.0
            - V1.0.25
            - V1.1.0
## Explanation for Version:
**1.0.0**
- First Digit Specifies Release
- Seconf Digit Specifies Major Changes
- Third Digit Specifies Minor Changes

## Architecture of Version Control System
- Centrelized VCS
- Distributed VCS

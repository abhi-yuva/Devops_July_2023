### Jenkins cont...
- In our Pipeline Automation we have different stages. Each stage will refer some actions in your project.
- We have different types of stages
    - Git checkout - Used to fetch the code from GitHub to Jenkins
    - Packaging - This is to create a package out of from source code depending on the particular language.
    - Artifactory
    - Static Code Analysis
    - Deploy

### Creating a Java File
- Maintain the following structure which is recommended when creating a pacakge management.
    - src
        - main
            - source-code
- Source Code of sample Java
```
package main;

class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
- Make sure you have installed java in your system, if not try to install with the below command.
```
choco install javaruntime
javac
```
- How to run your java file.
```
java filename
```
- Manifest file will looks like this. File name is **package.mf**
```
Main-Class: HelloWorld
```
- How to create a Jar File
```
jar -cvmf <file-name.mf> <package.jar> <classfile>

jar -cvmf package.mf package.jar HelloWorld.class
```
- As a package management/build tool we will be using **Maven** for java language
- Lifecycle of Maven
- The default lifecycle of maven contains 3 stages
    - Default
    - Build
    - clean

- The main and default lifecycle of maven is as follows
1. Validate - Validates your POM file and your Project.
2. Compile - This will convert your source code into byte code(.class). I will store class file in **Target Folder**
3. Test - It wil run your unit tests accroding to your test cases written. After running it will try to create a test results which will be the extension of **.xml file**. It will be stored under target folder with the following name **surefire-reports**. Test results files will be saved in the format of **TEST-*.xml**
4. Package - This will create your package(jar/war/ear). The format of your Package file is as follows
```
<artifact-id>-<version>.<package-format>
helloworld-1.0.0.jar
```
5. Install - Install the package in local repository. The default folder for maven is **M2_HOME** or **.m2**
6. Deploy - Copies the packages from your local system to Remote repository
7. Clean - It will try to remove your Target Folder.

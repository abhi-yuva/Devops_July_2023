## Terraform Cont...

### Create EC2 Instance from Terraform File.
- Before writing terrafrom file to create EC2 instace, try to capture the manual steps to create an EC2 Instance
- Manual Steps
    - Instance Name
    - No of Instances
    - AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
    - Instance Type
    - Key Pair
    - Security Groups
    - Volumes
    - Termination Protection

- Terraform file
```
resource "aws_instance" "my-ec2" {
    ami = "ami-03f65b8614a860c29"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    key_name = "jenkins-server"
    count = 1
    vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-08ac779c1bf102ceb"]

    tags = {
      Name = "My-EC2-Instance"
    }
}

```

- Terraform Plan

PS D:\Devops\July 2023\Terraform\terraform-files> terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions
are indicated with the following symbols:

## Terraform Cont...
- After initalization we have to do **terraform validate** which will check our terraform file is perfrectly alright or not and if it is not perfect it will try to show you the errors.
- After validate you have to check for the format of our terraform files that are we writing our file in correct sytactical way or did any mistakes.
- When you do run **terrafrom fmt** command it will try to adjust your terrform file which matches in correct syntactical format.
- Here is the example for terraform fmt
```
provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my-bucket" {
bucket = "s3-bucket-from-terraform-2023"
}


```
- After Terraform fmt
```
PS D:\Devops\July 2023\Terraform\terraform-files> terraform fmt
main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"

}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my-bucket" {
  bucket = "s3-bucket-from-terraform-2023"
}
```
- Before applying execution plan please perform **terrafrom plan**
- Terraform Plan will show you an blueprint that what actions your are going to perform
```

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

```
- Here is the process of terraform worflow
![Privew](./images/tf19.png)
- After terraform plan we have execute our resources with **terraform apply** command.
- When you run apply command it will try to show you the plan again and will ask for your confirmation to execute it or not.
```
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_s3_bucket.my-bucket: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.my-bucket: Creation complete after 6s [id=s3-bucket-from-terraform-2023]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```
- Only after apply it will execute your plan
![Privew](./images/tf20.png)

- Now we will see how terraform state file works
- Terraform plan if you do changes from terraform file
![Privew](./images/tf21.png)

- Terraform plan with AWS console changes. Our modification as like below

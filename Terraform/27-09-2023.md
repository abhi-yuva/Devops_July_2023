## Terraform Cont...

### Terraform Scenario
- As of now we are trying to create resources. I have a requirement that, I have multiple projects on which I have different environments.
- Each evironment I will be creating the same kind of resources.
- Here what ever the resouce we have creating in single project that we have to re-write with small changes.
- Either we copy paste or re-write both are same.
- Most of the time we are spending here to write the code and in our projects this will become as a duplate code in multiple places.
- This is not recommended way to optimize the code. 
- Is there any alternative to this?
- We have a concept called **[MODLUES](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules)** in Terraform. Where we can reuse the code.

## Terraform Modules
- A Terraform Module will allow us to create a login once and re-use it many times.
- This Module is a root resouce where we will be creating our resources 
- When ever we want to create any resource we will be calling that module instead of writing the code again.
- When ever we call this module we have to pass **inputs** to the module
- When calling module we have to specify the **path** of the module where it exists?
- There are two ways to maintain Terraform Modules
    1. In Remote Repository
    2. In our Local Systems
- When ever you are trying to call a Module in your source code you have re-initialize your terraform code again.

### How to Create a Module
- The resource file what ever we are trying to create will contain the base logic of the resource.
- The inputs and outputs related to the resource will also be in the same place.
- Keep all the root files in once place and call that it as a Module.

### How to use Modules
- To use modules we will follow the below syntax
```
module "<module-name>" {
  source = "<path-of-the-module>"

  input1 = "value1"
  input2 = "value2"
  
}
```

### Example to create EC2 instance by using Terraform EC2 Module
- [Refer Here](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws/latest) for Terraform EC2 Module information.
- Here are the changes of code with use of modules
```
module "instance" {
  source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git"

  name = "my-instance"

  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-123"]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-Module"
  }
}
```
- You have to Re-initialize your code to get the reference of your module
- Terraform Plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.instance.aws_instance.this[0] will be created
